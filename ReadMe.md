# Wine Recommender, A Virtual Sommelier

### The Project

I wanted a way to find new wines, or a new wine variety, based on a bottle I already know I enjoy. I used 50,000 wine reviews from Wine Enthusiast Magazine to find features about a preferred wine to recommend something new. My recommender examines a wine review and uses two separate models to examine the description, and then finds similar features of a different wine and makes a recommendation. I examined these two different models and determined which model is giving the best recommendation.
