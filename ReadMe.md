# Wine Recommender, A Virtual Sommelier

## The Project

I wanted a way to find new wines, or a new wine variety, based on a bottle I already know I enjoy. I used 50,000 wine reviews from Wine Enthusiast Magazine to find features about a preferred wine to recommend something new. My recommender examines a wine review and uses two separate models to examine the description, and then finds similar features of a different wine and makes a recommendation. I examined these two different models and determined which model is giving the best recommendation.

## The Data
My dataset consists of wine reviews from Wine Enthusiast Magazine that were scrapped by zackthoutt. Here is a link to the page where the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews. I used 50,000 wine reviews which consist of over 500 different varieties of wine. I examine the wine descriptions, which charaterize the wine's smells, flavors, and structure. I am looking for keywords that are unique to each bottle of wine to make a recommendation for a new bottle with similar keywords and characteristics. 


## The Recommender Models

### TF IDF Recommender



### LDA Recommender

Some of the keywords: 

Topic 1: Full, Fruits, Texture, Rich, Crisp, Fresh, Citrus, Apple, Spice, Light

Topic 2: Black, Cherry, Spice, Berry, Note, Opens, Pepper, Plum, Oak, Full
