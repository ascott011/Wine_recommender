Tense chalk, baking soda, pomelo pith and lime skin aromas show on the fresh and compelling nose. The palate is tightly wound and nervy, showing clean, grippy kumquat and citrus rind flavors. That tension holds firm even days after opening.   \n",

Bramare delivers cassis, plum and berry aromas rolled into a pleasant and familiar whole. Feels rich but refined, with meaty flavors that hit on leather, berry, black plum and chocolate. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2014.   \n",

The nose offers vegetal notes of bell pepper, licorice and ashy cigar box while the mouth provides more dark fruit flavors of plum and black cherry accented with spice. Medium mouthfeel with nicely integrated tannins and excellent balance. With 15 months spent in French oak, the finish is long and tinged with sweet cedar.   \n",

It's medium rich, quite tasty, with a nutty flavor and a lime-inflected finish.   \n",

Exceptionally complex for Washington Chardonnay, with good natural acidity, a mix of peach, apple and pineapple fruit, and a finish that shows tight layering. There is a dense core that should unravel with bottle age; this is that rare Washington Chardonnay that will prosper with cellaring.   \n",

The prickly mouth is loaded with orange oil citrus and a hint of banana unfolds on the long finish. A very clean and satisfying hand-picked Chenin Blanc that's a versatile wine for food pairing.   \n",
